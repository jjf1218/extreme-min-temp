# ONJSC Internship Work

## Overview

This repository houses some codes and projects done during my time as an intern at the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist (ONJSC). Two main projects were done, with more details below.

## Extreme Minimum Temperature Trends

A project through the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist to analyze minimum minimum temperatures at 6 New Jersey COOP stations. This research was presented at the 2017 Rutgers Climate Institue Climate Symposium.

## Precipitation Frequency

A project through the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist to analyze the annual frequency of different categories of precipitation events.

The National Climate Assessment report of 2014 (https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/, NCA 2014) reported that the percent increase in the northeast (defined as the heaviest 1% of daily events) has increased 71% from 1958 to 2012 (see Figure 2.18 at https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/heavy-downpours-increasing). This is an aggregate of stations.

Our goal is to see if this same percent increase is happening around the NJ COOP stations. Right now, in the development process, we are only concerning ourselves with the New Brunswick station (NEW BRUNSWICK 3 SE). Once we develop a method for analyzing one station, other COOP stations with reliable and lengthy periods of record will be analyzed.
